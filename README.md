## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

I created an application that takes in a employees first name,last name, id, title, and annual salary then it documents it on the dom adding the annual salary to the total montly amount per employee added. The application also has the ability to notify you when the total monthly has exceeded the 20000 limit and delete a employees information if it was added in by accident and subtract that employees annual salary from the total monthly salary.
